# Caesar Cipher

## Description

This is a JavaScript implementation of the Caesar cipher, a substitution cipher that shifts the letters of the alphabet by a certain number of positions. This implementation supports the Georgian, English, and Russian languages.

## Limitations

The Caesar cipher is a basic substitution cipher and is not considered secure for modern cryptographic purposes. It is susceptible to frequency analysis attacks and other cryptographic techniques. This implementation is intended for educational purposes and should not be used for sensitive information or real-world encryption needs.
